	<h2 style="text-decoration: underline;">Description</h2>
	<p style="font-size: large;">
		Toucans are relatively small birds with exceptionally 
		large beaks. Their long beaks are usually brightly 
		colored, and much longer and thicker than their actual 
		heads.

	<h2 style="text-decoration: underline;">Interesting Facts</h2>
	<p style="font-size: large;">
		There are many different and beautiful species of 
		Toucans, Toucanets, and Aracaris. Some interesting facts about
		these are listed below.
		<ul style="font-size: large;">
			<li>
				<b style="text-decoration: underline;"> Toco Toucan</b>
				: Toco is the largest 
				species of Toucan in the world. They are also 
				the most well-known of this species of bird. 
				It has the largest bill (but not the longest) 
				of all birds, in relation to its body size.
			</li>
			<li>
				<b style="text-decoration: underline;">Choco Toucan</b>
				: Choco is similar, but 
				less colorful, than its Toco cousin. The name 
				“Choco” is in reference to the forests that 
				these birds inhabit. Choco Toucans live in the 
				Choco rainforests.
			</li>
			<li>
				<b style="text-decoration: underline;">Black-Necked Aracari</b>
				: This species has 
				black feathers and a bright yellow underbelly. As 
				its name suggests, its throat is black. Midway down 
				its yellow belly, it has a thick stripe of bright red 
				feathers. These starkly contrasting colors are probably 
				where this bird got its nickname, the beautiful Aracari.
			</li>
			<li>
				<b style="text-decoration: underline;">Yellow-Browed Toucanet</b>
				: This little bird has green feathers and bright 
				yellow “eyebrows” over its eyes. They live only in 
				a tiny patch of rainforest in Peru.
			</li>
		</ul>
